Building a Database in Zig
============================

This tutorial walks through building a simple database from scratch in Zig,
based on the original `db_tutorial <https://github.com/cstack/db_tutorial>`_ in C.

Each phase builds upon the previous, progressively adding features while
demonstrating Zig's strengths in systems programming.
